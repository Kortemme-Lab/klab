Currently, this directory is a flat mess of sometimes unrelated utilities bundled together. My hope is that we will restructure this into an organized collection of useful scripts for the lab. With this in mind, I have created the fs subdirectory for filesystem related functions. -- Shane

Since this is a shared repository and the consensus in the lab is to use spaces rather than tabs for code, all code herein should use spaces. Feel free to remove tabs at will.
