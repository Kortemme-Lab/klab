                        <br>
                        A post-doctoral position is available in the Kortemme Lab to join our efforts in computational design of protein-based small molecule biosensors. The post-doctoral researcher will work closely with our computational design group to develop and apply methods to engineer novel functional protein interfaces, in particular utilizing newly developed methods for flexible backbone modeling (see <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v6/n8/full/nmeth0809-551.html">Nature Methods 6:551, 2009</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v5/n11/abs/nchembio.251.html">Nature Chemical Biology 5:797, 2009</a>). We are seeking a highly motivated, rigorous experimentalist with strong publications in international journals. Qualified candidates should expect or hold a Ph.D. in biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology or a related area. Experience with medium- or high-throughput assays, protein library construction, small molecule chemistry, or computational biology is a plus. The Kortemme Lab provides a stimulating interdisciplinary environment, with members from diverse backgrounds in computer science, physics, engineering, biology and biochemistry, combining experimental and computational techniques for tightly coupled feedback between design and testing.
