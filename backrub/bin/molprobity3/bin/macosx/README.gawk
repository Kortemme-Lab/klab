MolProbity depends on special extensions to AWK which are only present in Gawk.
Mac OS X systems do not come with GNU Awk.
Thus, this directory contains precompiled binary of GNU Awk (gawk) v3.1.3.
It was compiled on a PowerBook G4 running OS X 10.3.1.

3/14/06: Gawk 3.1.5 compiled for i386 on an Intel MacBook Pro running
Mac OS X 10.4.5.  The two versions were merged into a universal binary called
"gawk" using the "lipo -create" tool.

GNU Awk is free software available under the GPL.
See http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html.
