<h1>Adding pages to the MolProbity3 web interface</h1>
This document is a tutorial on adding new web pages to the graphical
side of MolProbity, that is, the MolProbity that you use via a web
browser. Before reading this, it would be a VERY good idea to read
through <a href="UI_Framework.html">the document on MolProbity's UI
framework</a>. You don't have to understand all of it, but it really is
important to see the overview. After you finish this tutorial, you
should go back and read it again, and it should be clearer.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Overview</h2>
As an example, this tutorial describes adding the "simple kinemages"
feature to MolProbity3, the one that allows users to choose one of the
basic Prekin scripts to make a kinemage, and then allows them to view
it in KiNG or to download it.<br>
<br>
Here are the steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a class that displays a web page for the user input, so
the user can choose a Prekin script to run. This class is called a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">delegate</span> and will live in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages/</span> folder.</li>
  <li>Add a link to this delegate page from one or more of the existing
pages in MolProbity.</li>
  <li>Create a PHP script that runs Prekin and produces the kinemage,
based on the user input. This script will run as a background job and
lives in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">jobs/</span> folder.</li>
  <li>Create a class that displays a web page that presents the
finished kinemage to the user, with links for downloading and viewing.
This class is also a delegate and will also live in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages/</span> folder.</li>
</ol>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>User input page</h2>
Copy the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">template-page.php</span>
from <span style="font-family: monospace;">doc/extending/</span> into <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages/</span>, and give it a new name
(like <span style="font-family: monospace;">makekin_setup.php</span>).
The file <span style="font-family: monospace;">makekin_setup.php</span>
in fact already exists, so that you can follow along in it and see the
actual code that is summarized below. Every script in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pages/</span> declares a class, and
those classes must all have unique names that exactly match their
filenames (with ".php" removed and and "_delegate" added). So, change
"template_delegate"
to "makekin_setup_delegate".<br>
<br>
The template contains a fair bit of junk that we don't need, but there
are a lot of other <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">xxx</span>_setup.php</span> scripts that
can be plundered for example code. It also inherits some functionality
from the <span style="font-family: monospace;">BasicDelegate</span>
class, which is definted in <span style="font-family: monospace;">event_page.php</span>.&nbsp;
We're going to start in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">display()</span>
function, which is
responsible for outputing the HTML web page that the user sees when
they get here. (We'll discuss <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>
they get here later on.)<br>
<br>
Display should start with <span style="font-family: monospace;">$this-&gt;pageHeader()</span>
and end with <span style="font-family: monospace;">$this-&gt;pageFooter()</span>.
These two functions take care of creating the &lt;HTML&gt; and
&lt;BODY&gt; tags, including stylesheets, etc. The header can
optionally generate a sidebar of links, timed commands to refresh the
page, and other things. By default, these functions are just wrappers
for <span style="font-family: monospace;">mpPageHeader()</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">mpPageFooter()</span> in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">core.php</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>The working content of the
page is quite simple: a list of radio buttons
for selecting the model (PDB file) to work with, a similar list of
buttons for the Prekin scripts, and a &lt;FORM&gt; to hold them. In
order for event handling to work properly, the form must be created
with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventForm()</span>
function, although it needs to be ended by a normal <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;/form&gt;</span> tag.<br>
<br>
The Prekin-script radio buttons are arranged in a table for easier
formatting, with
alternating colors for the rows. All the radio buttons have the same <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">name='scriptName'</span>, which is
what makes them act as a group (only one member of the group can be
selected at any given time). Each radio button has a different <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">value</span>, which we will use later
to decide which Prekin script to run.<br>
<br>
The buttons for selecting a model are very similar, and were in fact
stolen from one of the other <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">xxx</span>_setup.php</span> scripts. All
these buttons have <span style="font-family: monospace;">name='modelID'</span>.
Many things in MolProbity do not need to be reinvented -- there is
either a reuseable function available, or there is existing code that
can form a good starting point. In this case, we choose to copy and
modify because our requirements are subtly different from those of the
other pages.<br>
<br>
There are two submit buttons for this form, which both have <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">name='cmd'</span>. The text in their <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">value</span> property is what appears
as the button text, and it's what we'll use in a minute to decide which
one the user pressed, and whether they want to run Prekin or cancel
this operation.<br>
<br>
The other thing we need to declare is a function to handle the
form-submission event. We call it <span style="font-family: monospace;">onRunPrekin()</span>,
because that's the name we passed to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventForm()</span> back in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">display()</span>. It could take one or
more
arguments as well; this feature
exists to allow one function to handle many related &lt;FORM&gt;s, but
we only have one form that needs to be handled. All the data submitted
by the user in the form is available through the PHP superglobal <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST</span>. The keys of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST</span> are the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">name</span>s of things in the form, so
our keys are <span style="font-family: monospace;">scriptName</span>
(from the radio buttons) and <span style="font-family: monospace;">cmd</span>
(from the submit buttons). The values in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST</span> are the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">value</span>s specified in the form.<br>
<br>
Thus, we first use <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST['cmd']</span>
to decide if the user pressed the Cancel button or the Make Kinemage
button. Pressing Cancel leads us to return to the previous page using <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageReturn()</span>. (This requires
that the previous page got here by calling <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageCall()</span> rather than <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span>, which we'll ensure
it does in just a minute.) For now, the other button should just do
nothing. Doing nothing will just cause our form to be displayed again.
In a while, we'll add code to actually run Prekin when the button is
pressed.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Linking to the input page</h2>
Now that we have an input page, we need to be able to see it. Because
it's not a typical, simple PHP web page, you can't just go to its URL.
This is actually deliberate and a huge advantage for a web application,
as described in the UI Framework document. However, that means that we
need to connect it to the real site in order to try it out. There are
two places where we want to link it: from the site map, and from the
quick-links sidebar.<br>
<br>
The site map is generated by <span style="font-family: monospace;">pages/sitemap.php</span>.
There are lots of links here, so it's easy to copy &amp; paste a good
example. The key call is this one:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventURL("onCall",
"makekin_setup.php")</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
</span>Unlike other uses of <span style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventURL()</span>
we've seen, this one has <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span>
arguments. The first is still the name of the function that will be
called when the user clicks on the link. The second one will be passed
to that function as it's <span style="font-family: monospace;">$arg</span>.
This allows one function (<span style="font-family: monospace;">onCall()</span>)
to handle jumping off in any number of directions. Incidentally, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">onCall()</span> is defined in
the <span style="font-family: monospace;">BasicDelegate</span> class,
which is declared in <span style="font-family: monospace;">lib/event_page.php</span>.
If you go look at it, you'll see it just uses <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageCall()</span> to transfer control
to the named delegate page:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function
onCall($arg)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pageCall($arg);</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
The very similar <span style="font-family: monospace;">onGoto()</span>
event handling function uses <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span>
instead, but is otherwise identical. It's not appropriate here, because
we want to be able to "call" the Prekin page from anywhere and always
return to where we started from when it finishes. The trade-off we make
is that the Prekin pages must not display the sidebar, lest the user
jump out of our nicely constructed "loop" of Prekin pages.<br>
<br>
We add our page to the sidebar in a similar way, by editing <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lib/core.php</span>. (Not really
ideal, is it? This function should live somewhere else, but it's stayed
in the core as a historical artifact.) In the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">mpNavigationBar()</span> function,
duplicated one of the existing entries and modify it to look like this:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $s .=
mpNavBar_call('makekin_setup.php', 'Make simple kins');</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
Now we've succeeded in linking our page into the main site. Try
accessing your local development copy of MolProbity, and on the Site
Map page you should see a link to the kinemage-creation page, as well
as a link in the sidebar.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Running Prekin</h2>
Now that we've got an interface, it would be nice if it actually did
something when the user pushed the button. For that, we'll need a
command-line PHP script that actually does the work in the background
while <span style="font-family: monospace;">pages/job_progress.php</span>
is displayed in the web browser to keep the user entertained. Create a
new background job by copying <span style="font-family: monospace;">doc/extending/template-job.php</span>
to <span style="font-family: monospace;">jobs/makekin.php</span>.<br>
<br>
Here we don't have to worry about delegates and all that mess -- this
script runs in a much more straightforward manner. However, you'll
notice that it has to explicitly load the session data and initialize
the MolProbity environment in the first few lines of the script. These
chores are done for the delegate pages by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">public_html/index.php</span>, so they
never have to bother with it.<br>
<br>
Within the main part of the script, we retrieve form values from the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span> array, which
was filled with data from the form by our <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">onRunPrekin()</span> function. We also
make sure the kinemage file directory exists so we have somewhere to
put the output file -- notice that files are stored in directories
based on their type (PDB, kinemage, tabular ASCII data, etc) and are
named with a prefix that comes from their original PDB file.<br>
<br>
Next, we'll use a <span style="font-family: monospace;">switch</span>
statement to make sure that the specified script is a valid one. It's
very easy for someone to submit arbitrary data to a web form, so we
want to make sure the input is valid before running it on the command
line. This sort of precaution is very important -- it would be bad if
someone embedded a <span style="font-family: monospace;">"; rm -rf / ;"</span>
in the middle of your command! PHP has several built-in functions that
can also help protect you (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</span>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">escapeshellcmd()</span>); use
these when appropriate.<br>
<br>
Even though our script will run quickly, in just a few seconds, we
should display a status message for the user. Remember, the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">job_progress.php</span> page is being
displayed in the user's browser while <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span>
script is running in the background, and it gets refreshed every few
seconds with the latest status. The steps to be checked off are listed
in order in an array (call it <span style="font-family: monospace;">$tasks</span>),
and then you call <span style="font-family: monospace;">setProgress()</span>
to update which step is the active one. In our example, we have just
one step:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $tasks['kin']
= "Make kinemage using &lt;code&gt;Prekin $flag&lt;/code&gt;";</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setProgress($tasks, 'kin');</span><br>
<br>
Now were ready to execute the Prekin command. When it returns, we'll
call <span style="font-family: monospace;">setProgress($tasks, null)</span>
to mark all steps as complete, just before returning from the script.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to approach getting output to the user. We could
store some data in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span>
array (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</span> the name of the
kinemage file) and pass that to our "results" delegate page, which
would then use it to construct a bit of explanatory HTML with a link to
open the kinemage in KiNG. There's nothing wrong with that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">per se</span>, and that's the way a lot of
the old MolProbity was written. The alternative scheme is to construct
a result message or mini-page in HTML and store it as a lab notebook
entry. This is done as the last processing step of the background
script. Using a notebook entry has two benefits:<br>
<ol>
  <li>At any time, the user can go to the lab notebook page and see a
chronological, stream-of-consciousness record of all the results
they've produced during the MolProbity session.</li>
  <li>The user can edit the HTML of these entries in order to annotate
them, creating a rich record of the refitting process that can be
archived as part of a "real" lab notebook.</li>
</ol>
The disadvantage of a notebook entry is that it can only contain links
to "data" -- things like kinemages and charts. Trying to link to an
"active" page in the site via <span style="font-family: monospace;">makeEventURL()</span>
creates a link that will be stale and unusable by the time anyone
actually sees it. It's fairly rare that you need to do this, although
you can imagine (for example) the results from running Reduce having a
link that suggests running SSWING too. This sort of thing has to be
done from the delegate page that displays results (see the next
section). Most of the time, though, the results page can just display
the lab notebook entry that was created by the background job, which is
the approach we'll take in the next section.<br>
<br>
First, though, we have to create a notebook entry. It's quite simple:
just build up a string containing data and HTML formatting, like you
would embed in a &lt;BODY&gt; or &lt;DIV&gt; tag somewhere in a page.
Notice the <span style="font-family: monospace;">linkKinemage()</span>
convenience function for generating a kin-viewing link. Then call <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">addLabbookEntry()</span> with a title,
body, etc. and save the resulting entry ID so that the results page can
look it up and display it. Here we save the ID as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']['labbookEntry']</span>.
MolProbity's machinery for background jobs will automatically make this
available as <span style="font-family: monospace;">$context['labbookEntry']</span>
in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">display()</span> function
of the results page. Notice that all these machine-generated notebook
entries should be marked with the "auto" keyword, to distinguish them
from entries created <span style="font-style: italic;">de novo</span>
by the user.<br>
<br>
The last few lines of boilerplate code are very important, but don't
need any modification. They mark the background job as complete and
record the total running time. Nothing should come after them -- they
should be the last lines in the script. Once the script exits, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">job_progress.php</span> will notice
the background job is finished and control will be transferred to the
results page delegate.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Results page</h2>
The results page is very, very simple, because there are lots of
jobs already written that just need to display a lab notebook entry as
their results. All those jobs use <span style="font-family: monospace;">generic_done.php</span>
as the results&nbsp; page.<br>
<br>
This introduces the <span style="font-family: monospace;">$context</span>
variable for delegate pages.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$context</span> is a place to put data
that configures how a page looks, or to save data between views of this
same page -- sort of like member variable in an object.&nbsp; In fact,
that's how I should have implemented it, but I didn't, and it's too
scary to change it now, because they could collide with other member
variables.&nbsp; Anyway, the <span style="font-family: monospace;">setContext()</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">getContext()</span>
functions can be used to retrieve and replace this data.&nbsp; The<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> setContext()</span> function can
either be passed the whole context as an array, or a key and value to
be updated.&nbsp; That is,<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
setContext("foo", "bar");</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
is a shortcut for<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ctx =
getContext();</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ctx["foo"] =
"bar";</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
setContext($ctx);</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
Context persists while a delegate is on the stack.&nbsp; That is, it
will persist through a <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageCall()</span>
to a subroutine and the corresponding <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageReturn()</span>, but it will
disappear when <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> delegate
does a <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageReturn()</span> or a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span>.&nbsp; Context gets
used for things like flags that determine whether the "advanced
options" are visible or hidden, or for recording which folders are open
and which are closed in the file browser page.<br>
<br>
Notice that the data from <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span>
has been transferred to this page's <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$context</span>, so that it's easy to
retrieve the lab notebook ID number. That number can be used with <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">openLabbbook()</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">formatLabbookEntry()</span> to easily
retrieve and display the entry.<br>
<br>
Two event handlers are set up on this page: a button (form) to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageReturn()</span> out of the Prekin
loop, back to wherever we came from; and a link that will <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">pageCall()</span> the notebook
editting page.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Launching the background job</h2>
Now it's time to go back to <span style="font-family: monospace;">pages/makekin_setup.php</span>,
and make sure that when the user presses the "Make kinemage" button,
something actually happens. This involves three steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Pass all the data the user submitted in the HTML form (in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST</span>) to the background
job, by
storing that data in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span>
variable. In this case, there are only two pieces of data (which model
to act on, and which script to run) but a complicated input page might
provide tens of input fields that need to be made available to the
background job.</li>
  <li>Log a message about what's happening to the system log using <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">mpLog()</span>. While the lab notebook
serves as a log of sorts for the user, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">mpLog()</span> records short messages
in the system log. The system log can then later be parsed to provide
usage statistics for the MolProbity administrators. The log file has
one record per line with colon-delimited fields, so the proper message
format is a short unique identifier (in this case, "makekin") followed
by a colon and a longer, human-readable explanation of what's
happening, possibly with additional information about which options or
files were used.</li>
  <li>Use <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span> to
transfer control to <span style="font-family: monospace;">job_progress.php</span>,
which will display the progress messages while the background job is
running. This doesn't take affect until we exit <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">onRunPrekin()</span>, so you still
have time to launch the background job with <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>. It's very
important that <span style="font-family: monospace;">pageGoto()</span>
be called before <span style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>,
because the later freezes the session data. In fact, as a rule of thumb
nothing should be done after calling <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">launchBackground()</span>; it should
be the last call in the event handler.</li>
</ol>
That's it. Now when the user pushes the button on the set-up page, the
background job script will be started and the progress page displayed.
When the background job finishes, control will pass to the results
page, which will display the HTML notebook entry created by the
background job.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Denouement</h2>
Your script is finished -- now all that remains is to test and debug
it. Here are some hints:<br>
<ul>
  <li>PHP errors in the background script are particularly nasty
because the error messages don't show up anywhere obvious. Use the
"View &amp; download file" page to view <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">system/errors</span>, which should
have (most) the errors generated by any programs run in the background.</li>
  <li>Use <span style="font-family: monospace;">php -l</span> ("L" for
"lint") to check your scripts for syntax errors before trying to run
them. This is especially useful for background job scripts.</li>
  <li>You can also use the download page to view the contents of
kinemage files, which sometimes contain error messages instead of data
when something goes wrong.</li>
  <li>Make sure your variable names are spelled correctly. I'm always
mistyping variable names and then wondering why my variable doesn't
have any data in it. This can happen when you copy and paste, too.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ditto for making sure the <span style="font-family: monospace;">name</span>
fields in your HTML forms actually match up with the variable names
you're looking for in <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_REQUEST</span>
or in <span style="font-family: monospace;">$_SESSION['bgjob']</span>.</li>
  <li>Make sure you've included the library/libraries you need using <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">require_once()</span>. Missing library
function definitions will crash your script.</li>
  <li>Document the inputs and outputs of your own library functions. In
detail. You won't remember later.</li>
  <li>Read the existing documentation, both in the code (comments) and
in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">doc/</span> folder.<br>
  </li>
  <li>When in doubt, look for something that already exists that's
similar to what you want. I've done the best I can with MolProbity's
architecture, but it's still complicated and difficult to remember. I
am constantly using the existing code as a reference manual.</li>
</ul>
