- I put together a script (run_rmsd_calc.pl) that accepts as input the name of the pdb file and the number
  of files (default 100) to have open at one time. It writes a Chimera script for calculating the RMSD between all
  the backrub conformations within a given folder (2000 which includes all last and low for a given temp) to 
  the original pdb structure in that folder (e.g. 1A8G.pdb). We are using Chimera's matchmaker command for 
  calculating the RMSD between two structures.
- A full description of the MatchMaker procedure can be found here: www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/framecommand.html
- In short MatchMaker works like so:
  Mmaker (or matchmaker) is the command-line implementation of MatchMaker, which superimposes structures by first creating a pairwise sequence alignment,
  then fitting the aligned residue pairs. Residue types and/or secondary structure information can be used to align the sequences. 
  Fitting uses one point per residue: CA in amino acid residues and C4' in nucleic acid residues. If a nucleic acid residue lacks 
  a C4' atom (some lower-resolution structures are P traces), its P atom will be paired with the P atom of the aligned residue.

  Example:

  mm #0 #1 show true
  (example structures: pectate lyases 1jta, 1bn8)
  - superimpose model 1 onto model 0 using default settings. Default settings are to compute secondary structure assignments with the 
    ksdssp algorithm, generate sequence alignments using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with the BLOSUM-62 residue similarity matrix 
    (weight 0.7) and secondary structure scoring (weight 0.3), keep the sequence alignment for the best-scoring pair of chains 
    (one from model 0 and one from model 1), and using that alignment, iteratively fit the structures with a cutoff of 2.0 Ã….

- 1VIK was the last one ran

-commands executed
create chimera script: ./run_rmsd_calc.pl 1SBG 100
run chimera script:    nohup /kortemmelab/home/rocco/apps/chimera/bin/chimera --nogui calc_rmsd_with_orig.com > 1SBG_rmsd_orig.txt &
get the matches:       grep match 1SBG_rmsd_orig_1.2.txt | awk '{print $2 $7}' > 1SBG_1.2_Matches.txt
get the RMSDs:         grep RMSD 1SBG_rmsd_orig_1.2.txt | awk '{print $7}' > 1SBG_RMSDs_KT1.2.txt

- 04/14/11: I believe this script needs to be run within the directory where the backrub structures exist (e.g. 1VIK_ensemble).
