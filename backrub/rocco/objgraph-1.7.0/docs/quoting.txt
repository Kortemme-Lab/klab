Quoting unsafe characters
-------------------------

Let's make sure our string quoting function can handle *anything*:

    >>> import objgraph
    >>> all_the_chars = dict((chr(i), i) for i in range(256))
    >>> objgraph.show_refs(all_the_chars, too_many=600,
    ...                    filename='all-the-chars.dot')
    Graph written to all-the-chars.dot (513 nodes)

Trust me, you do not want to see the resulting image.
