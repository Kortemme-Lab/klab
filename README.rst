klab - The Kortemme Lab Tools Repository
========================
A collection of utilities used by our lab for computational biophysics, including PDB parsing, SGE cluster submission scripts, and interfaces with the Rosetta macromolecular software suite.

Since this is a shared repository and the consensus in the lab is to use spaces rather than tabs for code, all code herein should use spaces. Feel free to remove tabs at will.
